    /// @details This function needs to be called during the init phase.
    ///          It performs two required action for motor control:
    ///             - configure the Arduino hardware TIMER1 to generate a high-frequency signal
    ///             to drive the motors.
    ///             - configure the Arduino hardware TIMER2 to generate a time-based interruption every
    ///              5ms.
    /// @note     This function assumes that the motor driver is mapped to the following pins:
    ///              - right motor: PWM pin 9 (aka OCR1A) direction pin 8
    ///              - left motor: PWM pin 10 (aka OCR1B) direction pin 12

    ///          The duty cycle variable also encodes direction: thus, -1 is full reverse, 1 is full
    ///          forward, 0 is power off.
